I was stuck at first with how to display array elements on separate lines. I mistakenly was trying to pass the entire array without specifiying its element's index. Only after googling I found out that we can derive an index from *ngFor and use that index to specify which array element we want to dispaly. IÂ also used 2 arrays to track click coordinates and time and displayed them both in the template.
