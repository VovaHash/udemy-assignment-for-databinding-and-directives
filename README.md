I was stuck at first on how to display array elements on separate lines. I mistakenly was trying to pass the entire array without specifiying its element's index. Only after googling I found out that we can derive an index value from *ngFor and use this index to specify which array element we want to display. IÂ also used 2 arrays to track click coordinates as well as time, and dispayed them both in the template via string interpolation.

Also, did an older task from this course on databinding.
